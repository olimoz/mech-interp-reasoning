    "\n",
    "This notebook establishes an agentic workflow for an LLM to interrogate an ARC challenge's data, so self reflect on responses and finally, propose a predicted output for the challenge. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by adapting Microsoft Research's agentic framework, Autogen, with access to a Jupyter Notebook. In this implementaiton the agent is permitted to use code to access and view data and to resolve the challenge itself. This is to test whether access to a symbolic logic tool, such as code, enables the LLM to score more highly on the ARC challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code allows for the agent to loop over a number of the challenges in a stateless fashion. This means the agent has no memory, so it cannot learn techniques as it progresses over the challenges.\n",

    "### The Agentic AI Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extend Microsoft Autogen with ability to code in a stateful Jupyter Notebook for coding python\n",
    "    - The child Notebook will have its own kernel, but use the same python environment (inc same packages) as this parent notebook\n",
    "    - The notebook records the agent's comments (aka reasoning) as markdown cells, their code as code cells and the code outputs as output fields.\n",
    "    - This growing notebook will form the context window for each new call to the Data Scientist\n",
    "        - We will use approx 150k input tokens and 6k output tokens per challenge question, which is approx $0.55 on Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Functions to access the challenge data\n",
    "    - Straightforward helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functions to set up a two agent conversation in Autogen:\n",
    "    - First agent is a data scientist given the task to inspect the data and write python code to represent the mapping from input to output\n",
    "    - Data Scientist role is played by Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n",
    "    - Second agent is the child notebook, it is not an LLM. This agent simply executes the code and returns output to the notebook.\n",
    "    - The session between the data scientist and notebook kicks off with a detailed description of the task, which is submitted to the data scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Functions to manage the execution and record results\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Main - Execute the challenge\n",
    "    - Simply loop over all challenge questions, opening a new notebook for each and recording the outcome\n",
    "    - Each challenge question is limited to just 15 conversation turns. \n",
    "    - This 'early stopping' prevents wasting tokens, rarely do agents solve a challenge they are repeatedly struggling with.\n",

    "### Other Variations Attempted But No Longer Used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Same as above but GPT-4o as Data Scientist. \n",
    "    - Scored poorly (<10%), Claude 3.5 Sonnet appears better suited to this task\n",
    "2. Same as above, but having inspected the data, the Data Scientist is invited to simply 'estimate' the output grid, not produce code to calculate it\n",
    "    - This is very token efficient, saving all code production, however success rate halves.\n",
    "3. Team chat.\n",
    "    - Initially a team comprised of Data Scientist (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), Critic (GPT-4o), Chat Manager (GPT-4o) and Notebook (not LLM) was attempted. \n",
    "    - Critic was intended to enable self reflection, however, this was verbose and expensive whilst adding only small increase in performance\n",
    "    - In a multi agent chat each agent receives the full notebook as their context, this arrangement had three LLM's so used triple the tokens as the above approach. \n",
    "    - As an aside, it was discovered that only GPT-4o or GPT-4 can act as effective chat managers, Claude 3.5 Sonnet cannot.\n"

    "\n",
    "We are working on the ARC AGI challenge. This involves a series of json files, each of which contains a handful of pairs of grids. \n",
    "Each pair has an input and an output grid. Each grid is simple a numpy array of integers. \n",
    "Your task is to discover the single mapping which converts each input grid to its corresponding output grid and apply that to the test input, arriving at a test output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## YOUR APPROACH\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Start by visualizing and analyzing each input-output pair carefully. \n",
    "    2. Look for consistent transformations across all training pairs. \n",
    "    3. Develop a hypothesis about the mapping logic and refine it as you examine more pairs. \n",
    "    4. Implement the hypothesized logic in Python. \n",
    "    5. Test the function(s) on all training pairs to verify accuracy. \n",
    "    6. Assume numpy, but also consider using image processing libraries like skimage for more complex transformations. \n",
    "    7. Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. \n",
    "    8. Use helper functions for repetitive tasks. \n",
    "    9. When ready, apply your function on the test input grid to predict the output grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOTE ON ACCESS TO TEST DATA\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can access and view the final test grid as follows, assuming you wish to print_to_screen:\n",
    "        input_test = get_test('data/{train_or_eval}/{filename}', print_to_screen=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you have successfully predicted the output grid for the test input grid, \n",
    "    save the numpy array as text, being careful to use this filepath:\n",
    "        np.savetxt('predictions/{train_or_eval}/{filename}_output_test.txt', output_test, fmt='%d', delimiter=',')\n",
    "\n",
    "## WHEN COMPLETE, END THE CONVERSATION\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the project is complete, meaning the mapping has been tested AND proven on all training pairs AND a test output has been computed AND saved to file\n",

    "### TRAINING DATA:\n",
    "\n",

    "### MAPPINGS ARE COMBINATIONS OF TRANSFORMATIONS\n",

    "\n",
    "    Grid Expansion and Repetition (Tiling):\n",
    "    - Simply expand the grid and repeat (tile) the input grid into the output grid\n",
    "    Symmetry and Mirroring (flipping):\n",
    "    - Horizontally or vertically\n",
    "    Propagation of patterns:\n",
    "    - Identify non-zero clusters or shapes in the input grid and propagating them in the output. Proceeding horizontally, vertically or diagonally.\n",
    "    Mathematical Operations:\n",
    "    - Incrementing values, taking modulo, or performing addition.\n",
    "    Color/Value Substitution:\n",
    "    - Values in the input grid replaced with different values in the output grid, often changing all instances of one number to another\n",
    "    Shape Detection and Transformation:\n",
    "    - Identifying geometric shapes in the input grid and applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, translation and/or overlapping.\n",
    "    Grid Segmentation:\n",
    "    - Divide the input grid into sections and apply transformations to each section.\n",
    "    Boundary Detection and Fill:\n",
    "    - Identify the boundaries of shapes or patterns and fill them with specific values. This sometimes involved propagating values from the edges inward.\n",
    "    Connectivity-based Transformations:\n",
    "    - Using connected component analysis to identify and transform groups of connected cells.\n",
    "    Rule-based Transformations:\n",
    "    - Applying specific rules based on the arrangement of values in the input grid. These rules often considered the neighboring cells of each position.\n",
    "    Coordinate-based Transformations:\n",
    "    - Using the coordinates of cells to determine how they should be transformed or moved in the output grid.\n",
    "    When the pattern is more complex than originally assumed:\n",
    "    - Review all training pairs again and try to describe the transformation in plain language\n",
    "    - Do not leap immediately to code\n",

      "\n",
      "We are working on the ARC AGI challenge. This involves a series of json files, each of which contains a handful of pairs of grids. \n",
      "Each pair has an input and an output grid. Each grid is simple a numpy array of integers. \n",
      "Your task is to discover the single mapping which converts each input grid to its corresponding output grid and apply that to the test input, arriving at a test output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## YOUR APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Start by visualizing and analyzing each input-output pair carefully. \n",
      "    2. Look for consistent transformations across all training pairs. \n",
      "    3. Develop a hypothesis about the mapping logic and refine it as you examine more pairs. \n",
      "    4. Implement the hypothesized logic in Python. \n",
      "    5. Test the function(s) on all training pairs to verify accuracy. \n",
      "    6. Assume numpy, but also consider using image processing libraries like skimage for more complex transformations. \n",
      "    7. Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. \n",
      "    8. Use helper functions for repetitive tasks. \n",

      "We are working on the ARC AGI challenge. This involves a series of json files, each of which contains a handful of pairs of grids. \n",
      "Each pair has an input and an output grid. Each grid is simple a numpy array of integers. \n",
      "Your task is to discover the single mapping which converts each input grid to its corresponding output grid and apply that to the test input, arriving at a test output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## YOUR APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Start by visualizing and analyzing each input-output pair carefully. \n",
      "    2. Look for consistent transformations across all training pairs. \n",
      "    3. Develop a hypothesis about the mapping logic and refine it as you examine more pairs. \n",
      "    4. Implement the hypothesized logic in Python. \n",
      "    5. Test the function(s) on all training pairs to verify accuracy. \n",
      "    6. Assume numpy, but also consider using image processing libraries like skimage for more complex transformations. \n",
      "    7. Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. \n",
      "    8. Use helper functions for repetitive tasks. \n",

      "\n",
      "We are working on the ARC AGI challenge. This involves a series of json files, each of which contains a handful of pairs of grids. \n",
      "Each pair has an input and an output grid. Each grid is simple a numpy array of integers. \n",
      "Your task is to discover the single mapping which converts each input grid to its corresponding output grid and apply that to the test input, arriving at a test output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## YOUR APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Start by visualizing and analyzing each input-output pair carefully. \n",
      "    2. Look for consistent transformations across all training pairs. \n",
      "    3. Develop a hypothesis about the mapping logic and refine it as you examine more pairs. \n",
      "    4. Implement the hypothesized logic in Python. \n",
      "    5. Test the function(s) on all training pairs to verify accuracy. \n",
      "    6. Assume numpy, but also consider using image processing libraries like skimage for more complex transformations. \n",
      "    7. Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. \n",
      "    8. Use helper functions for repetitive tasks. \n",

      "    Propagation of patterns:\n",

      "    - Incrementing values, taking modulo, or performing addition.\n",
      "    Color/Value Substitution:\n",

      "    - Divide the input grid into sections and apply transformations to each section.\n",
      "    Boundary Detection and Fill:\n",

      "    Connectivity-based Transformations:\n",
      "    - Using connected component analysis to identify and transform groups of connected cells.\n",
      "    Rule-based Transformations:\n",
      "    - Applying specific rules based on the arrangement of values in the input grid. These rules often considered the neighboring cells of each position.\n",
      "    Coordinate-based Transformations:\n",

      "We are working on the ARC AGI challenge. This involves a series of json files, each of which contains a handful of pairs of grids. \n",
      "Each pair has an input and an output grid. Each grid is simple a numpy array of integers. \n",
      "Your task is to discover the single mapping which converts each input grid to its corresponding output grid and apply that to the test input, arriving at a test output.\n",
      "\n",
      "## YOUR APPROACH\n",
      "\n",
      "    1. Start by visualizing and analyzing each input-output pair carefully. \n",
      "    2. Look for consistent transformations across all training pairs. \n",
      "    3. Develop a hypothesis about the mapping logic and refine it as you examine more pairs. \n",
      "    4. Implement the hypothesized logic in Python. \n",
      "    5. Test the function(s) on all training pairs to verify accuracy. \n",
      "    6. Assume numpy, but also consider using image processing libraries like skimage for more complex transformations. \n",
      "    7. Break down complex transformations into simpler steps. \n",
      "    8. Use helper functions for repetitive tasks. \n",
      "    9. When ready, apply your function on the test input grid to predict the output grid.\n",
      "\n",
      "## NOTE ON ACCESS TO TEST DATA\n",

      "    You can access and view the final test grid as follows, assuming you wish to print_to_screen:\n",
